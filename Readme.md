# Project Name:  Image Caption Generator

Developed an image captioning system by combining features from EfficientNet and SAM (Segment Anything Model) for enhanced visual understanding. Extracted and fused global and segmentation-aware features to generate accurate captions. Implemented a Transformer-based decoder to produce context-rich descriptions, improving performance over standard single-feature models.
